## üìñ Overview

The **Golf Equipment Detection App** is a Streamlit-based web application designed to identify golf equipment in images, extract relevant text using Azure OCR, and predict the equipment's market price. It leverages a custom-trained **YOLOv11** model (`best.pt`) for object detection, Azure Cognitive Services for text extraction, and an XGBoost model for price prediction. The app supports detection of golf equipment categories such as drivers, fairway woods, hybrids, irons, wedges, putters, golf bags, and golf balls, with price predictions for select categories.

This project is ideal for golf enthusiasts, retailers, or developers interested in computer vision and price estimation for sports equipment.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Object Detection**: Uses a custom-trained YOLOv11 model to detect golf equipment in images with adjustable confidence thresholds.
- **Text Extraction**: Extracts text from images using Azure OCR to identify brands, condition, and manufacturing year.
- **Price Prediction**: Estimates equipment prices based on detected attributes (brand, type, condition, age) using a pre-trained XGBoost model.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly experience, including image upload, detection visualization, and manual input forms.
- **Automated and Manual Predictions**: Supports automatic price estimation from detected attributes and manual input for custom predictions.
- **Custom Dataset**: Trained on a custom dataset tailored for golf equipment, ensuring high detection accuracy for specific categories.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Azure Account**: Subscription key and endpoint for Azure Cognitive Services (Computer Vision)
- **Dependencies**: Listed in `requirements.txt`
- **Model Files**:
  - YOLOv11 model: `best.pt`
  - XGBoost model: `xgb_model.json`
  - Encoders: `ohe_encoder.pkl`, `ordinal_encoder.pkl`, `feature_columns.pkl`

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/golf-equipment-detection.git
   cd golf-equipment-detection
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download Model Files**:
   - Place `best.pt` in the project root or update `model_path` in `main.py`.
   - Place `xgb_model.json`, `ohe_encoder.pkl`, `ordinal_encoder.pkl`, and `feature_columns.pkl` in the specified paths or update `load_p_model()` in `main.py`.

5. **Configure Azure OCR**:
   - Obtain your Azure subscription key and endpoint from the Azure portal.
   - Input these in the app's sidebar or set as environment variables:
     ```bash
     export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY="your_key"
     export AZURE_ENDPOINT="your_endpoint"
     ```

6. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

---

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Launch the App**:
   - Run the app using the command above. It will open in your default browser (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`).

2. **Configure Settings**:
   - In the sidebar, adjust the **Confidence Threshold** for YOLOv11 detection (default: 0.5).
   - Enter your **Azure Subscription Key** and **Endpoint** for OCR functionality.

3. **Upload an Image**:
   - Upload a PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP, or BMP image of golf equipment.
   - The app displays the uploaded image and the detection results side by side.

4. **View Detection Results**:
   - Detected equipment is highlighted with bounding boxes and labels.
   - A summary shows detected items and their confidence scores.

5. **Text Extraction**:
   - Azure OCR extracts text, identifying brand, condition, and year if present.
   - Extracted text is displayed below the detection summary.

6. **Price Prediction**:
   - If brand, type, condition, and year are detected, the app automatically predicts the price.
   - Alternatively, use the manual form to input details and estimate the price.

## üåü Future Improvements

- Add support for price prediction of golf bags and golf balls.
- Implement dynamic model path configuration via environment variables.
- Enhance OCR accuracy with pre-processing techniques for low-quality images.
- Integrate additional detection models (e.g., DETR) for comparison.
- Deploy the app to a cloud platform like Heroku or Azure for public access.
